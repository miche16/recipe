Ingredients
Cookie Dough
1 cup unsalted butter, softened Use Smart Balance for dairy-free/vegan.
1 ½ cups granulated sugar
2 large eggs Use Bob's Red Mill gluten-free egg replacer.
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour with xanthan gum I like Pillsbury gluten-free. Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. You may experience different baking results depending on the gluten-free flour blend you choose.
2 teaspoons cream of tartar If you don't have the cream of tartar, you can substitute 2 teaspoons baking powder for BOTH the cream of tartar and the baking soda.
1 teaspoon baking soda
¼ teaspoon salt
Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture
¼ cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
